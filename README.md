# Indigo Harbour — Beta 0.01

Welcome to **Indigo Harbour**, an atmospheric exploration game set in a quiet coastal town wrapped in fog, mystery, and long-forgotten secrets.  
This is the **Beta 0.01** build — very early, experimental, and actively evolving.

## 🌀 About the Game

Indigo Harbour is designed as a slow-burn mystery experience. Players explore a desolate harbour town, uncover environmental clues, and slowly piece together the events that led to its abandonment.

The focus of this early build:
- Core movement and exploration
- Initial world layout and environmental design
- Mood, tone, and visual identity
- Early interactions and basic systems

This version is not meant to represent final gameplay — everything is subject to change.
